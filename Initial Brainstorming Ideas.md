# Top 3 Ideas Evaluation
1. Environmental impact app
   - **Description**: Track your carbon footprint and compare with friends. App can provide suggestions for how to improve carbon footprint. Possibly highlight areas where some individuals have higher footprints than others. Use API's to display information about the city's current ecological footprint.
   - **Category:** Environment
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for tracking ecological impact as it provides a easy opportunity to compare with family and friends. We could use google maps to provide information about where a person is for info about their current location. Other than this however, there isnt much of a need for a mobile app.
   - **Story:** Users can post some of the common factors to help determine a estimate of their carbon footprint such as electric and gas usage, gas efficiency and mileage, number of flights taken (or miles traveled). Once the overall "score" is computed, users can compare with people around them or friends and family to see their overall score and additional details.
   - **Market:** Any people interested in helping the environment.
   - **Habit:** This app does have a very limited usage after determining their impact and may be accessed a couple times a month. 
   - **Scope:** Fully completed, this app would be fairly challenging to complete depending on how many of these features we decide to implement if you are seeing the score of others around you.
2. Recipe / Cooking App

    - **Description**: View recipes from different food cuisines and favorite multiple recipes. Recipes can be viewed in detail and a gallery of photos can be created for each recipe and displayed for each user profile. Recipes can also be converted based on serving amounts the recipe calls for and/or metric conversions.
   - **Category:** Food
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential because in a kitchen setting, most people are utilizing their cellphones rather than a computer. A mobile application would provide ease of access to recipes and important kitchen tools such as metric conversions in one consolidated platform.
   - **Story:** Users can view a feed of recipes. Users can go to a search tab and type a keyword for recipes. Recipes are displayed as a list, and a user can click on a button and view the detailed version of the recipe. Users can like/dislike a recipe and upload a photo and short caption along with their like/dislike entry. Users submitted reviews will be displayed on their profile.
   - **Market:** Any person interested in cooking or the social aspect of cooking.
   - **Habit:** Families who cook, students who are cooking in dorms would be using the app consistently. Individuals interested in trying out new recipes / frequently cook as a hobby.
   - **Scope:** This app would not be extremely difficult to build. One feature that would be difficult to complete is keeping track of the review system and the constant display of values from database/API.
4. Expense Tracker
   - **Description**: kepps track of all expenses for the month and sees if it met the specific goal. Possibly have goals for specific categories?
   - **Category:** Finance
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the instant logging of expenses and then the social aspect with comparing with others. 
   - **Story:** Allows users to set a goal for a spending limit then have users enter how much they spent and users can track trends of where money is spent.
   - **Market:** Any user trying to track spending.
   - **Habit:** Constantly update how much you are spending
   - **Scope:** V1 would allow for complete tracking of spending for the month and reset every month.
